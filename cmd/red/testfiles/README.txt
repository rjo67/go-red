Contains files for 'cmd' tests.

test1.txt           input file for test1
commands-test1.txt  ed-commands for test1
compare-test1.txt   expected contents of output file

The output of the ed commands should be written to the 'output' directory,
i.e. the commands file should end in a write command, e.g. 'w testfiles/output/test1.txt'.
